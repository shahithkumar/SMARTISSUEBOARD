## ✨ Key Modules & Features

### 1. Unified Dashboard (The Board)
The central hub of the OS. It provides a real-time overview of all active, in-progress, and resolved issues. 
- **Active Metadata**: Instantly see who is assigned, the priority level, and the current status.
- **Visual Priority**: Color-coded priority levels (High, Medium, Low) ensure critical issues are never missed.
- **Click-to-Investigate**: Every issue card is an entry point into a detailed investigation console.

### 2. System Intelligence (Analytics)
Transform raw technical data into actionable insights through a suite of interactive charts:
- **Priority Distribution**: A bird's-eye view of your project's risk profile.
- **Team Workload**: Analyze individual performance and resource allocation.
- **Activity Trends**: Track issue creation over time to identify bottleneck patterns.

### 3. Investigation Console (Issue Detail)
A deep-dive interface for solving complex problems:
- **Activity History**: An immutable log recording every status change and priority update for audit compliance.
- **Comment Threads**: Real-time mission dispatches between team members.
- **Metadata Grid**: Quick-reach stats for created dates, reporters, and last activities.

### 4. Identity & Profile Console
A secure module for managing user presence within the system:
